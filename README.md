# BiometricByPass

**Generative Modelâ€“Driven Presentation Attacks against ECG-based authentication systems**  
This project explores how **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** can create counterfeit ECG signals to bypass biometric authentication systems.  
We focus on the **PTB-XL ECG dataset** and experiment with **1D-CNN**, **LSTM**, and **STFT-based** GAN architectures, combining **Conditional GAN (CGAN)** and **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** techniques.

## ðŸ“œ Project Summary

Biometric authentication, particularly **ECG-based biometrics**, offers enhanced security over passwords. However, advances in **deep learning** and **generative models** have introduced new vulnerabilities. This project demonstrates that:

- Robust ECG authenticators can be trained using limited leads.
- GANs can reconstruct target ECG leads from alternative leads.
- These reconstructions can successfully perform **presentation attacks**, reducing the reliability of ECG-based systems.
